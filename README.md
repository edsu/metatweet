metatweet is a Twitter bot that watches for changes in tweet metadata.  You can
see the latest blueprint of JSON fields that have been found in tweets
[here](https://github.com/edsu/metatweet/blob/master/blueprint.json). You can
find an instance running [@tweetjson](https://twitter.com/tweetjson).

You will need to set the following variables in your environment before you run
`metatweet.py`:

* CONSUMER\_KEY
* CONSUMER\_SECRET
* ACCESS\_TOKEN
* ACCESS\_TOKEN\_SECRET

metatweet was loosely inspired by Bradley Fidler and Amelia Acker's idea of
*infradata* from their paper [Metadata, infrastructure, and computer-mediated
communication in historical perspective](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23660).
